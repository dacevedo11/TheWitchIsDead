                Once upon a time, there was a kind and wise and beautiful witch who lived in the forest with her
                familiars,
                and her life was peaceful and happy until a <strong class="highlight">FUCKING WITCH HUNTER</strong>
                broke
                into her cottage and
                dragged her out and <strong class="highlight">FUCKING MURDERED HER</strong> and now she's DEAD.
                But if you get revenge and kill him and bring his <strong class="highlight">EYES</strong> to her corpse
                within a week she'll
                come back to life. Or so you've heard.
                Even if it doesn't work, at least he's dead.
