                most tasks that are normal to humans are really Difficult for animals,
                unless they are broken into smaller steps. <strong class="highlight">you don't have opposable
                    thumbs</strong> and
                all you know of the human world is what the Witch taught you. You can talk to other animals
                of the same or similar species.
